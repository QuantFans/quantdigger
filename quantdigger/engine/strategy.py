    Strategy is an abstract base class providing an interface for

    The goal of a (derived) Strategy object is to generate Signal
    objects for particular symbols based on the inputs of Bars 
    (OLHCVI) generated by a DataHandler object.

    This is designed to work both with historic and live data as
    the Strategy object is agnostic to the data source,
